Stock Price Dashboard (Flask + API)
I’ve always been fascinated by stocks and enjoy experimenting with technology, so I decided to merge these interests into a project! 
Recently, I’ve been diving into Flask, and I wanted to put what I've learned into something practical that I could use in my daily life.
While this project is still a work in progress, it’s functional and provides a real-time view of stock prices and trends. 
It fetches stock data using an API and displays key statistics in an intuitive dashboard.
